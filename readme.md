# Backend repository
Pipe is a package manager for WaxusBS. On release 2 it will use it's own archieves (lie.de), but on alpha phase it will use .zip or .tar.gz (not sure, because I am gonna use both in my tests)

# What WaxusBS is
WaxusBS is a Unix-like operating system. I wanted to give people, who are tryna move to, for example, Linux, a chance to use it. WaxusBS has it's own manual for it's commands and explanation how it can be used. My main purpose is to create a light-weight operating system, which won't use 90 threads and 5000GB RAM. Isn't it easier to install Arch Linux or Gentoo Linux instead? Yeah, maybe, but I'm gonna try to make it a lil easier. Another main purpose is to make other people use Linux, FreeBSD and others Unix-like operating systems.

# What files "one", "one.rs", "two", "two.rs"...
I am testing it currently so I need to transfer all these files between my PC and laptop. It is the only reason why it is here
